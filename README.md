The intended customers are those who spend money online and want a safe transaction.

The type of service PayPal offers that it's competitors doesn't is the availability in almost all online stores.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I really don't believe they need to do much as their services offer a lot of stuff already. However, when going international China's WeChat has these barcodes at physical stores to pay for products and so I wish PayPal would expand to physical stores so that I can pay just by using my phone. (Although Apple has this technology already).

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This would benefit the company as it evolves their target audience and invites more people into PayPal.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

PayPal would utilize a more scanning technology or a more convenient approach of touch and pay.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

They are appropriate because times are changing and what I know now can impact an evolution. People back in the 1900s didnt see the need for a phone to allow payments and now it is relevant. Now, when I see it on my phone I need to ask where can it go and realistically the next step is really to bring it physical.
